Connection Adapters
===================
.. _connection_adapters_header:

Pika provides multiple adapters to connect to RabbitMQ:

- :py:meth:`~adapters.select_connection.SelectConnection`: A native event based connection adapter that implements select, kqueue, poll and epoll.
- :py:meth:`~adapters.asyncore_connection.AsyncoreConnection`: Legacy adapter kept for convenience of previous Pika users. It is recommended to use the SelectConnection instead of AsyncoreConnection.
- :py:meth:`~adapters.tornado_connection.TornadoConnection`: Connection adapter for use with the Tornado IO Loop http://tornadoweb.org
- :py:meth:`~adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingConnection`: Enables blocking, synchronous operation on top of library for simple uses. This is not recommended and is included for legacy reasons only.
